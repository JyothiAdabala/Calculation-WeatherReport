### Objective : 
  - This Chatbot performs calculations by evaluating the expressions given by the user.
  - It also provides weather report for the user specified city.

Then, bot asks user about the job to be performed. If the user gives the calculation option then it takes the expression from the user to evaluate and then it produces the final result of the expression.Otherwise, if user selects weather report option then it asks for cityname from the user and gives the weather report for the user specified city.
